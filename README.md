    <h2>Where to Buy Amyet Bikes in 2025: The Smartest Choices</h2>
    <h3>1. Buy Direct from the Official Amyet Website (Best Choice for 2025)</h3>
    <p>By far, the fastest, safest, and most cost-effective way to buy an Amyet bike is through their official website:<br>
    <a href="https://www.amyet.com/?ref=Deal10" target="_blank">Amyet.com</a></p>
    <p><strong>Why shop directly through Amyet.com?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>First access to the newest models and colors</li>
        <li>Official warranty and customer support included</li>
        <li>Free U.S. shipping on all orders</li>
        <li>Exclusive online offers like <strong>10% off using Amyet Discount Code: Deal10</strong></li>

    <h3>2. Through Online Marketplaces (Amazon, eBay, Walmart Marketplace)</h3>
    <p>You might occasionally find Amyet bikes listed on platforms like Amazon, eBay, or Walmart Marketplace. While convenient, these listings often come from third-party sellers. That means you might not get the same warranty or post-purchase support as you would when buying directly.</p>
    <p><strong>üí° Our Honest Recommendation:</strong> Always check seller ratings and confirm warranty details before purchasing Amyet bikes through third-party platforms.</p>
    <h3>3. Local Bike Shops & Dealers (Limited Availability)</h3>
    <p>Amyet is gradually expanding into local retail networks. In certain U.S. cities, you might find:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Independent bike stores carrying Amyet demo models</li>
        <li>Outdoor gear shops with limited stock</li>
        <li>E-mobility showrooms specializing in electric transportation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, as of 2025, most Amyet inventory is still primarily available online. Local dealers may offer test rides but expect higher pricing than ordering directly from the website.</p>
